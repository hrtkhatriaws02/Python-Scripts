# Python-Scripts

This directory contains a collection of Python scripts written for personal practice, learning, and experimentation.

Descriptions of what each script does are maintained separately in `index.txt`.

## How to Run

Use Python 3.x to execute any script:

```bash
python hrtk_0001.py

**index.txt**

This file acts as a simple reference index. It contains a list of script filenames along with a short description of their functionality.

Happy experimenting! 🧪🐍
